# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes NFL quarterback statistics from **2019–2023**, focusing on the relationships between:  
1. **Yards After Catch (YAC)** vs **Passing First Downs**  
2. **Passing Attempts** vs **Interceptions**  

I applied correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman) and create visualizations to understand how these metrics relate to quarterback performance and team outcomes.

# 📊 Load Data & Libraries

```{r}
library(nflverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(gt)
library(flextable)
library(regclass)

# Load data for 2019-2023
stats <- load_player_stats(seasons = 2019:2023)
```

# 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

### Top 5 Most Common Positions
```{r}
position_counts <- as.data.frame(table(stats$position)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Freq)) %>%
  head(5)

# Create a nice table
position_counts %>%
  rename(Position = Var1, Count = Freq) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Top 5 Most Common Positions") %>%
  cols_label(Position = "Position", Count = "Count")
```

# 📈 Correlation Analysis

### 1. Yards After Catch vs Passing First Downs

```{r}
# Pearson correlation test
assoc_yac_fd <- associate(passing_yards_after_catch ~ passing_first_downs, data = stats)
assoc_yac_fd
```

**Interpretation:** A strong positive correlation would suggest that quarterbacks whose receivers gain more yards after catch are more likely to sustain drives by converting first downs.

📊 Visualization:

```{r}
ggplot(stats, aes(x = passing_first_downs, y = passing_yards_after_catch)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkred", fill = "pink", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Yards After Catch & First Downs",
       x = "Passing First Downs",
       y = "Passing Yards After Catch")
```

### 2. Passing Attempts vs Interceptions

```{r}
# Spearman correlation test (association)
assoc_att_int <- associate(interceptions ~ attempts, data = stats)
assoc_att_int
```

**Interpretation:** A positive correlation would indicate that quarterbacks with more passing attempts also throw more interceptions, likely reflecting game scripts or riskier passing strategies.

📊 Visualization:

```{r}
# Clean data to remove missing values
cleaned_stats <- stats %>%
  filter(!is.na(attempts), !is.na(interceptions),
         is.finite(attempts), is.finite(interceptions),
         attempts > 0, interceptions >= 0)

ggplot(cleaned_stats, aes(x = attempts, y = interceptions)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "darkred", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Association Between Interceptions and Passing Attempts",
       x = "Passing Attempts",
       y = "Interceptions")
```

# 📊 Distribution of Passing Yards (QBs Only)

```{r}
qb_stats <- stats %>% filter(position == "QB")

ggplot(qb_stats, aes(x = passing_yards)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Passing Yards for Quarterbacks (2019–2023)",
       x = "Passing Yards", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# 📋 Summary Statistics

```{r}
summary_table <- stats %>%
  select(passing_yards_after_catch, passing_first_downs, interceptions, attempts)

summary(summary_table)
```

# 🏟️ Football Insights

- **YAC vs First Downs:** Shows how important ball placement and receiver ability are for sustaining drives.  
- **Attempts vs Interceptions:** Demonstrates the tradeoff between high passing volume and turnover risk.  
- **QB Passing Yards Distribution:** Confirms variation in passing production across quarterbacks.  

# 🚀 Next Steps

- Extend analysis to include **completion percentage, touchdowns, and sack rate**.  
- Build predictive models to forecast QB efficiency based on these features.  
- Compare rookie vs veteran quarterbacks.
